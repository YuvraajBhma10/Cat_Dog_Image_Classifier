# Cat_Dog_Image_Classifier
In this project, I tackled the task of cat vs dog image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Initially, I gathered a diverse dataset containing labeled images of both cats and dogs. Employing various preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation, I prepared the data for model training. I then experimented with different CNN architectures, incorporating convolutional and pooling layers along with fully connected layers. Through iterative training and validation, I fine-tuned the model's parameters to optimize performance while mitigating overfitting. Finally, evaluation on a separate test set demonstrated the model's ability to accurately classify images as either cats or dogs.
